        "Interesting Fact": "The Brown-capped Rosy-Finch has the most restricted range of the three rosy-finch species, breeding almost exclusively in the mountains of Colorado and a small portion of Wyoming.",
        "Description": "The Brown-capped Rosy-Finch is a small, stocky finch with a rich brown body, distinct brown cap, and rosy pink highlights on the wings, belly, and rump. Males are more vibrantly colored than females. These birds are alpine specialists, nesting in rock crevices on steep cliffs. In winter, they may form mixed flocks with other rosy-finch species and move to lower elevations, but they rarely leave the vicinity of mountains. They are adapted to find food in snowy conditions by using their strong bills to uncover seeds."

        "Description": "The Purple Finch is a stocky finch with a short, conical bill and a notched tail. Males have a rose-red head, breast, back, and rump, with brown wings and tail and little streaking on their belly. Females are brown and heavily streaked with a distinctive white eyebrow and facial striping. Often confused with the similar House Finch, Purple Finches have a more robust build, shorter and less deeply notched tail, and males have a more extensive red coloration. Their song is a rich, sweet warble that lacks the harsh notes of the House Finch."

        "Description": "The Northern Flicker is a large, brownish woodpecker with a white rump patch visible in flight and distinctive black spotting on its belly and chest. There are two main color forms: 'Yellow-shafted' in the east and north (with yellow underwings and a red crescent on the nape) and 'Red-shafted' in the west (with salmon-pink underwings and no red nape). Both forms have a gray head, tan face, and a black bib. Unlike most woodpeckers, they spend considerable time on the ground foraging for ants. Their bouncing flight pattern and loud, piercing call make them easy to identify in the field."

Breeding males are bright yellow with a black forehead, black wings, and white markings on wings and tail. Winter males and females are more dull olive-brown with pale yellow underparts and black wings with white wing bars.

Males are larger and entirely iridescent black with a purple-blue sheen, yellow to amber eyes, and a heavy, pointed bill. Females are significantly smaller and brown, with darker wings and tail and paler underparts. These social birds are often found in noisy flocks along the southeastern coastal United States. Males perform elaborate courtship displays, spreading their tail feathers like the hull of a boat (hence the name), puffing up their feathers, and making a variety of mechanical-sounding calls."

These highly camouflaged birds are masters at blending into tree bark, often perching motionless in tree cavities. They are nocturnal hunters using their excellent hearing and vision to locate prey. Despite being common throughout eastern North America, they are seldom seen due to their small size, camouflage, and nocturnal habits."
