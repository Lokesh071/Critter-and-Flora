Despite their tiny size, they descend from large working sled dogs and retain a bold, spirited temperament. Nicknamed 'the little dog who thinks he can,' Poms are confident and often behave as if they're much larger than they actually are. They're intelligent, alert watchdogs and devoted companions who bond closely with their owners, though they can be somewhat reserved with strangers."

        "description": "English Bulldogs are medium-sized dogs with a distinctive pushed-in nose, undershot jaw, and rolling gait. Originally bred for bull-baiting, modern Bulldogs bear little resemblance to their ancestors in temperament - today they're known for their gentle, affectionate nature. Though they may look tough with their wrinkled face and stocky build, they're typically sweet-natured and good with children. They're relatively inactive indoors and don't require extensive exercise, making them suitable for apartment living. Due to their brachycephalic (short-nosed) structure, they can be prone to breathing difficulties and overheating."
